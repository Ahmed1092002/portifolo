---

## 💡 Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Motion with Purpose**
Every animation serves a functional purpose:
- Guide user attention
- Provide feedback
- Show relationships
- Create hierarchy
- Delight users

### 2. **Layered Depth**
Visual layers create depth:
1. Background particles (furthest)
2. Floating 3D objects
3. Content and UI
4. Cursor and effects (nearest)

### 3. **Progressive Enhancement**
- Works without JavaScript (basic content)
- Adds animations when supported
- Graceful degradation on older devices
- Mobile-optimized interactions

### 4. **Consistent Timing**
- 0.8s for major transitions
- 0.3s for micro-interactions
- 2s for ambient animations
- Coordinated stagger delays
